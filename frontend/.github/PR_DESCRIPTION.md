# API Integration Plan and Base Infrastructure

## Overview
This PR sets up the foundation for integrating our frontend with the backend API. It includes comprehensive documentation and base infrastructure for API integration.

## Changes
- Added detailed API integration plan (`docs/API_INTEGRATION.md`)
- Created base API client with error handling (`src/api/client.ts`)
- Set up directory structure for API integration

## API Integration Plan Highlights
1. **Phased Approach**
   - Phase 1: API Contract Definition
   - Phase 2: Environment Setup
   - Phase 3: API Integration
   - Phase 4: Testing & Validation
   - Phase 5: Monitoring & Maintenance

2. **Documentation**
   - Defined all required endpoints
   - Documented data schemas
   - Outlined integration testing strategy
   - Added environment configuration guide

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Base API client with axios
   - Error handling with custom APIError class
   - Authentication interceptors
   - TypeScript types and interfaces

## Next Steps
- [ ] Review API contract with backend team
- [ ] Set up staging environment
- [ ] Begin endpoint implementation
- [ ] Create integration test suite

## Testing
- Base API client is set up with proper error handling
- Documentation has been reviewed for completeness
- Directory structure follows best practices

## Screenshots
N/A - Infrastructure and documentation changes only

## Additional Notes
This PR serves as a foundation for our API integration. It will help the team understand what endpoints are needed and how to implement them consistently.
